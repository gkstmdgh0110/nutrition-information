    <p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Specifications-of-whey-protein-isolate_tbl2_326667167" target="_blank" title="Specification of whey protein isolate.">Proteins</a> are large biomolecules and macromolecules that comprise one or more long chains of amino acid residues.Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalysing metabolic reactions, DNA replication, responding to stimuli, <strong>providing <u>structure</u></strong> to cells and organisms, and transporting molecules from one location to another.</p>
    <img src="protein.jpg" width="100%">
    <p style="margin-top: 45px;">Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids, which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes, and which usually results in protein folding into a specific 3D structure that determines its activity.</p>
